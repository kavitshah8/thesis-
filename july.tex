	Reading SIA & Secure Hierarchical In-Network Aggregation (SHIA) in Sensor Networks in parallel.

	Key points from Secure Hierarchical In-Network Aggregation in Sensor Networks in parallel.

		Distinction Between :
			Network Topology
			Aggregation Tree
			Commitment Tree 

			Commitment tree is derived from Aggregation tree which is derived from Network topology. Currently we focus on the problem in which we have aggregation tree as an input and trying to tweak its security. 

		SHIA generates balanced binary commitment tree for verification.
		It sends label a special data structure for it's verification and authentication purpose.


\section{SHIA Summary}

- Realizing distinction between Network topology, Aggregation tree & Commitment tree.
- Benefits of using binary tree:
	Ease of analysis
	Ease of devising analysis algorithm
	Ease for leafs to identify which tree are they part of ?
