\section{Secure Aggreagation}

David Wagner in Resilient Aggregation in Sensor Networks describes various attacks on aggregation schemes and introduces stastical estimation theory to secure aggregation. It helps deciding secure aggregation function by defining function is resilient or not.

SIA: Secure Information Aggregation in Sensor Networks proposes secure aggragation scheme for single-aggregator model. It provides stastical security properties.
