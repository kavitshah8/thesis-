	\section{Interactive and non interactive proof}

	Interactive proof between two parties. 
	Setup, proof & probability. Probability of cheating is (1/2)^(#round).For example, for first round pr. of cheating is (1/2), for second round it is (1/4), for third round it is (1/8) and so forth.

	So, to have higher confidence you need to do more rounds which consumes a lot of bandwidth. So, the idea is to make it non interactive.
