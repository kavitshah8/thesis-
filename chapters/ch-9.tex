\chapter{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK} 
\label{cha:conclusion}

	In this thesis, we have shown data aggregation is an important primitive to save bandwidth in the sensor network which are becoming pervasive in our day-to-day life.
	We built our protocol on top of Secure Hierarchical In-network Data Aggregation protocol which provides data integrity to the hash tree.
	Firstly, we modified the label structure of SHIA to make it more communication efficient by removing the redundant field in its data-item.
	Secondly, we represent a mathematical way of analyzing the protocol. 
	We also propose an algorithm to find all possible cheaters in the network.
	In addition, we identify the significance of finding an adversary in a network is critical. 
	We propose an algorithm which can detect an adversary in the network and remove it for all the future queries.
	Furthermore, we give the proof that complete binary tree is an optimal data structure to build the commitment tree.

	The security in unstructured networks without a trusted authority is very hard.
	It can be simplified by giving structure to the network and trusted authority.
	In the future, we would like to analyze this protocol for various network topologies and generalized the results.
	It is our hope that further research can improve the cheater detection algorithm.
	Furthermore, analyzing these security protocols can provide additional insights into the network models that closely represent the real-world applications.
