\label{cha:Secure Hierarchical In-network data aggregation}

We describe the Secure Hierarchical In-network data aggregation $\textit{(SHIA)}$ protocol of \cite{chan2006secure} as our work enhances this protocol by making it more efficient and adding new capabilities to the protocol.

The goal of $\textit{SHIA}$ is to compute aggregate functions (such as $\textit{SUM}$, $\textit{AVERAGE}$, $\textit{COUNT}$) of the sensed values by the sensor nodes while assuming that a portion of the sensor nodes are controlled by an adversary which is attempting yo skew the final result.

Describe their label format with an example.
Then elaborate your approach.
Two differences:
	data-item format
	CT generation being root in as many trees as possible
