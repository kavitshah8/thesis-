\chapter{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Do we hash node's id in the commitment field of its data-item? NO
	\item Do we send the payload signature in case of Figure 5.4? YES
\end{itemize}

To do list:
\begin{itemize}
	% \item ch-3: signatures from 628; All PKI are not digital signatures capable.
	% \item ch-5: Clear goals of the protocol.
	% \item Review the writing.
	% \item ch-2: Add smooth transition to the security section.
	% \item ch-2: add more applications in section 2.1.
	% \item ch-4: change sign label
	% \item ch-4: Why SHIA does not have ID in their label? Why do you have ID? What benefits you get out of it?
	% \item Cheating: Improve existing example.
	% \item Cheating: Analysis of possible cheaters.
	\item Meeting: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Summary of wagner's work has been moved to chapter 3
		\item Should I include summary of table in detail of just with the security level column
	\end{itemize}
	\item ch-3: Digital signatures helps authentication, non-repudiation, data integrity

\end{itemize}
	
	Compare number of signatures in both approaches are same but amount of signing is different.
	Compare number of certificates in both approaches.

	Matrix for choice of protocol
		Number of certificates
		Number of signing
		Number of signatures
		Power consumption

	Matrix for different topologies
		star, palm, binary 
		
	Savings the BW then make decision with power analysis.
