\chapter{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Do we hash node's id in the commitment field of its data-item? NO
	\item Do we send the payload signature in case of Figure 5.4? YES
\end{itemize}

To do list:
\begin{itemize}
	% \item ch-3: signatures from 628; All PKI are not digital signatures capable.
	% \item ch-5: Clear goals of the protocol.
	% \item Review the writing.
	% \item ch-2: Add smooth transition to the security section.
	% \item ch-2: add more applications in section 2.1.
	% \item ch-4: change sign label
	% \item ch-4: Why SHIA does not have ID in their label? Why do you have ID? What benefits you get out of it?
	\item Cheating: Improve existing example.
	\item Cheating: Analysis of possible cheaters.
	\item Cheating: Cheating detection with CT generation.
	\item Cheating: Cheating detection with off-path distribution.
	\item Cheating: Cheating detection with both scenarios in place.

	\item ch-4: Image modifications. Update images with darker borders. Decrease width. Save word as pdf and then crop images
	\item Review the writing.

	\item 3. Discuss cheating, distributing off-path.  
	\item ch-6: Why don't you need signatures with off-path?
	\item ch-4: Advantages of signing the B's payload.

	\item ch-3: cite book for digital signatures

	\item ch-6: removing old signatures, and signing those again
	\item ch-6: equation for number of certificates needed in the network
