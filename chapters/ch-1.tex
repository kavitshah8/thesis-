	The trend in consumer electronics is to embed a microprocessor in everything-cellphones, car stereos,  televisions, watches, Global Positioning Systems (GPS) receivers, digital cameras.
	In some specific environments such as avionics, electronic devices are already becoming networked; in others, work is underway.
	Medical device manufacturers want instruments such as thermometers, heart monitors and blood oxygen meters to report to a nursing station; kitchen appliance vendors envisage a future in which the oven will talk to the fridge, which will reorder food over the net. 
	It is to be expected that, in the near future, this networking will become much more general.
	The next step is to embed a short range wireless transceiver into everything; then many gadgets can become more useful and effective by communicating and cooperating with each other.
	A camera, for example, might obtain the geographical position and exact time from a nearby GPS unit every time a picture is taken, and record that information with the image.
	At present, if the photographer wants to record a voice note with the picture, the camera must incorporate digital audio hardware; in the future, the camera might instead let the photographer speak into her digital audio recorder or cellphone.
	Even better, the audio data might optimally take a detour through the user's powerful laptop, where a speech recognition engine could transcribe the utterance, so as to annotate the photograph with searchable text rather than just with audio samples-and of course this could be done at any time that the camera detects the proximity and availability if the laptop with the speech recognition service.
	In this scenario each device, by becoming a network node, may take advantage of the services offered by other nearby devices instead of having to duplicate their functionality.
	Mark Weiser of Xerox PARC \cite{weiser1991computer} coined the term ``ubiquitous computing'' in $1988$. 
	\textbf{ubiquitous computing} is the scenario in which computing is omnipresent, and particularly in which devices that do not look like computers are endowed with computing capabilities.
	For example, light switches, door locks, fridges and shoes have data processing power in them.
	It is situation in which all those devices are note only capable of computing but also of communicating, because they have synergy
	then makes the whole worth more than the sum of the parts.
	We do not expect a fixed networking infrastructure to be in place-certainly not one based on cables.
	It would be less practical to run data cables between switches, fridges and locks-not to mention shoes.
	A wireless infrastructure looks more plausible: as happens with mobile telephones, a base station could cover a cell, and a network of suitable positioned base stations could cover a larger area.
	But we are interested in a broader picture, in which even this arrangement may not always be possible: think of a photographer taking pictures in the desert and whose camera wants to ask the GPS unit what coordinates and time stamp to associate with the picture.
	The computing and the communications may be ubiquitous, but the network infrastructure might not be.
	In such cases the devices will have to communicate as peers and form a local network as needed when they recognize each other's presence.
	This is what we by \textbf{as hoc networking}.
	The wireless network formed by the camera and the GPS receiver is ad hoc in the sense that it was established just for that specific situation instead of being a permanent infrastructural fixture.

	It is very important to talk about security issues in such scenarios.
	The term is not new or unfamiliar, but it is overloaded and may be interpreted differently by different readers.
	A common mistake is identify security with cryptology, the art of building and breaking ciphers (cryptography and cryptanalysis respectively).
	While it's true that cryptology gives computer security many of its technical weapons, to identify the two i                                

	Security is really risk management, 
	Security is assessing threats (bad things that may happen, e.g. your money getting stolen), vulnerabilities (weakness in your defenses, e.g. your front door being made of thin wood and glass) and attacks (ways in which the threats may be actualized, e.g. a thief breaking through the weak front door while you and the neighbors are on holiday), estimating the cost for the threats, estimating the probabilities for the attacks given the vulnerabilities, developing appropriate safeguards (a prior vaccines) and countermeasures (a posteriori remedies), and implementing the ones for which the certain price of the defense is worth spending compared to the uncertain loss that a potential threat implies.

	In this context cryptology is only one of many tools, not the discipline itself.
	Schneier, author of an extremely popular cryptography textbook \cite{schneider1996applied}, candidly admits in a later book \cite{schneier2011secrets} to having previously missed the forest for the trees.
