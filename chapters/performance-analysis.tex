\section{ A Notations }
	We are enhancing the analysis done in \cite{alzaid2008secure}.
	We consider the case in which intermediate nodes are sensors as well as aggregators, which makes network homogeneous. 
	According to us these scenario is more practical as it allows any node to be an intermediate node  according to the current state of the network and also allows dynamism in the network. We keep the same notations used in \cite{alzaid2008secure} to be consistent.

\section {B Number of transmitted bits}
	First, we start analyzing the case in which no aggregation and no security are used.
	Suppose all nodes in the network sends raw or encrypted data($x$ bits), sensor node ID data($y$ bits) and overhead data($oh$ bits) towards its parents which are $x+y+oh$bits long.
	Total number of bits traveled within the network is approximately, 
	\begin{equation}
				
	\end{equation}
	Special thing about your analysis is that you consider the case where aggregators are sensors as well. DO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE IT.
