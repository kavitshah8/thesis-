\chapter{Secure Data Aggregation Scheme}

	The goal of this thesis is to examine secure data aggregation schemes for various distributed systems. 

	Many modern world system designs are distributed in nature. The system design includes small, individual components doing their tasks precisely and lots of these components synchronize with all other components to complete the bigger task.  


	Many applications of sensor network are inharenlty distributed in nature.
	For example, scientific data collection, building health monitoring , building safety monitoring systems are distributed systems.
	Write an example how data aggregation happes in one particular application.\cite{wagner2004resilient}

	The application design architecture for the internet of things is distributed as well. Write an example how data aggregation happens in one particular application.
